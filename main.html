  <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
  <p>Time complexity is a way to measure how efficiently an algorithm runs based on the size of its input. It describes how the number of operations or steps required by a program grows as the input increases, helping us understand whether an algorithm will remain practical for larger data sets. An algorithm with lower time complexity is generally more efficient, meaning it can process information faster and handle larger inputs without a significant increase in execution time. By analyzing time complexity, developers can compare different approaches and choose the most efficient solution for a problem.</p>
  <p><b>Space complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run, based on the size of its input. It includes memory used by variables, data structures, function calls, and any extra space required during execution. An efficient algorithm not only saves time but also minimizes memory usage. For example, if an algorithm has a <b>space complexity</b> of O(n), it means the memory it uses grows linearly with the size of the input. This is important because excessive memory usage can slow down a program or even cause it to crash, especially with large data sets.</p>
